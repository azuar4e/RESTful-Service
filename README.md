### Operations


### How it works

To run the project we have to options:

- Using **docker**: Since we hace a Dockerfile and a `docker-compose.yaml` we can launch it using `docker compose up -d` (or without `-d` flag). This will create two containers, one for the backend of the aplication, accesible from port `8080`, and other for the postgres database.
